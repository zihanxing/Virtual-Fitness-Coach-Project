- **Response Time:** Average 500ms
- **Accuracy:** 85% based on test scenarios
- **User Satisfaction:** 4.5/5 from user feedback surveys

## Unit Tests

Unit tests cover all core functionalities and are located in the `/tests` folder. These include:

- Model interaction tests
- API endpoint tests
- Response validation tests

## CI/CD Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions and includes the following stages:

1. **Installing Dependencies:** Sets up Python and Docker toolchains.
2. **Formatting:** Ensures code is properly formatted.
3. **Linting:** Checks code quality using linters.
4. **Running Unit Tests:** Executes all tests to ensure functionality.
5. **Building Docker Image:** Creates the Docker image.
6. **Pushing to Container Registry:** Publishes the image to GitHub Packages.

## Model Selection

The application uses the [Mozilla Llamafile](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile) for model selection. It is configured to utilize a local .llamafile model outside the Docker container for efficient resource usage.

## Frontend/UI

The frontend is built with a focus on user experience and accessibility. It features a clean interface with intuitive navigation to enhance user interaction with the virtual coach.
